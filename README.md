# FlareSnip ðŸ”¥

This is an open source URL shortener, built with Next.js in TypeScript, using Cloudflare's D1 and Workers KV.

It is loosely based on the [Next Lucia Auth](https://github.com/saasykits/next-lucia-auth) starter.

## Temp Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/)
- [React Email](https://react.email/)

I'm planning on removing or replacing some of these.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Replace PostgreSQL with D1
- [ ] DB schema
- [ ] Redirect route
- [ ] Account dashboard
- [ ] URL list
